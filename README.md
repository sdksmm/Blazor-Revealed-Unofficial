# Blazor-Revealed-UnOfficial
This repo is an uofficial project of the repository that accompanies Blazor Revealed by Peter Himschoot (Apress, 2018) (https://github.com/Apress/blazor-revealed) 

In this repo I have corrected the minor details that prevents the official repo to run in Visual Stuido 2019. 
You can download this repo and create the database by running the SQL script (inside the SQL folder "PizzaPlace070.Server" project). 

Hereafter you may continue following the book (https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484243428). 

Let me know if there are any issue with my repo.
